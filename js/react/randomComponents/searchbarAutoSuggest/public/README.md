## Autosuggest Input

We all have tried Google search input. It's pretty cool how it shows you some suggestions based on your typing. We need to create exactly the same. Consider a search location feature, where you are adding names to your city and country. Implement a search feature with a list of cities and countries and show user options based on what the user is typing.

This is one of the most frequently asked questions in the interviews. So that is a bonus point.

Features to include in it -

- A search input with auto suggest option.
- Enable debouncing feature to save excess api calls.
- Use any api or json list to show suggestions
